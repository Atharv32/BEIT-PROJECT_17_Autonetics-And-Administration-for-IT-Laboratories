# BEIT-PROJECT_17_Autonetics-and-administration-for-IT-laboratories

In this modern era of Automation,it has been observed that many of the University
and college Labs do not have IT automation capabilities up to the current industrial modern
standards.The latest technologies aren't being implemented in colleges and thus the students
can't benet from them. The concept of automation has existed from couple of years but they
typically just consisted of performing small tasks such as switching on and o of appliances
automatically. In this automation project, we try to implement both the Lab as well as IT
automation services together as a package.The IT automation tasks include many services
such as automatic installation and uninstalling of several soft-wares whenever needed through
SSH networking. The Lab administrator has the option to deliver a set of messages or referral
links to the students in a live time scenario. Also an online register would be really helpful
for the sta to create a record of the student's activities with timestamps.
